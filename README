## Dependencies

### Catch2

Automatically pulled in by the CMake setup, but it must already be available on your system.   

If running Debian-based systems, this is as simple as `apt install catch2`



## Testing Strategy

This project has chosen in-tree tests (vs out-of-tree) because the test-files are located next to the test-target files. They are thematically and logistically co-located, and therefore removes unnecessary path actions.
